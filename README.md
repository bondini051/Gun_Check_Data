The Gun Data from the FBI's NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System)
shows the gun permit checks from November 1998 to present. The data is broken into monthly reports and is available online
through the FBI's website, FBI.gov. The data does not represent gun purchases but rather background checks. 
As the FBI's site advises, there is not a one to one correlation between checks and gun purchases. 
Each column in the data show different types of checks that occurr.
The question that I would like to answer is whether or not gun checks increase in the run up to the 2016 US Presidential Election. 
I will further break this down to see if the increases happen on party lines by showing the differences 
in permit checks between Red (Republican) and Blue (Democrat) States.

The data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System has limitations.  Gun checks do not mean gun purchases.
Gun permit checks are the checks that go through when you purchase a firearm or apply for a gun license.  
There is no license needed in using the FBI data.

Data Analyst Nanodegree.
